## Abstract:
-	The focus of the project is to find the most suitable clothing matches for the current selection and choice of clothing using existing pre-trained Deep Learning based feature extractors.
-	In addition, we also aim to use Siamese Network to find the similarity between images across different categories.
-	The Siamese Network incorporated with the feature maps extracted from VGG16 was able to fully capture the visual similarity and clothing category matching the real intentions of the user.
